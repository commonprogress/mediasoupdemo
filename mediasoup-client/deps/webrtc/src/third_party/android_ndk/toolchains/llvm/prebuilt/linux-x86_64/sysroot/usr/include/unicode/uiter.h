 * of the character iterator.

 * With some UCharIterator implementations (e.g., UTF-8),

 * relatively slow because the iterator has to "walk" from a known index
 * to the requested one.

 * an internal index (UTF-8: the source byte array index) for
 * fast, constant-time restoration.

 * the UTF-16 index may not be restored as well, but the iterator can deliver

/**
 * C API for code unit iteration.
 * This can be used as a C wrapper around
 * CharacterIterator, Replaceable, or implemented using simple strings, etc.
 *
 * There are two roles for using UCharIterator:
 *
 * A "provider" sets the necessary function pointers and controls the "protected"
 * fields of the UCharIterator structure. A "provider" passes a UCharIterator
 * into C APIs that need a UCharIterator as an abstract, flexible string interface.
 *
 * Implementations of such C APIs are "callers" of UCharIterator functions;
 * they only use the "public" function pointers and never access the "protected"
 * fields directly.
 *
 * The current() and next() functions only check the current index against the
 * limit, and previous() only checks the current index against the start,
 * to see if the iterator already reached the end of the iteration range.
 *
 * The assumption - in all iterators - is that the index is moved via the API,
 * which means it won't go out of bounds, or the index is modified by
 * user code that knows enough about the iterator implementation to set valid
 * index values.
 *
 * UCharIterator functions return code unit values 0..0xffff,
 * or U_SENTINEL if the iteration bounds are reached.
